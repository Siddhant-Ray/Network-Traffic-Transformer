\chapter{My Appendix}
\label{app:a}

If you want to add material which is not absolutely necessary to understand and
follow your work, put it in the appendix. Here you could also show important
code snippets or additional plots.

Put hyper parameters (learning rate, etc.)  for the NTT in a table here.
Can also put code snippets (probably not though)
