\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

Talk about people not trying this, today -> tomorrow vision similar to HotNets

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Talk about generalisation problem in ML on networks
\item Redoing everything from scratch always
\item Wish to develop scalable deep learning for general networks
\item Introduce generalisation techniques of pre-training and fine-tuning

\item Some network behaviour is learnable to an extent due to underlying deterministic structure 
\item Improve performance in networks, learn behaviour during pre-training, improved prediction during fine-tuning
\item application to video streaming, congestion control etc, lesser packet drops and retransmission 
\item useful for datacenter networks
\end{itemize}

\section{Task and Goals}
\label{sec:task}

Present NTT in brief, what is possible to be learnt, what we learnt, mention the design and training tasks and expectations 

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item Background on Transformers in Chapter \ref{cha:background}
\item NTT detailed design in Chapter \ref{cha:design}
\item NTT detailed evaluation in Chapter \ref{cha:evaluation}
\item NTT future research directions in Chapter \ref{cha:outlook}
\item Concluding remarks in Chapter \ref{cha:summary}
\item Further technical details in  Appendix \ref{app:a} and  \ref{app:b} 

Over here, will write, part of the work conducted during this thesis has been submitted as the following paper\cite{newhope}, and hence, some of key ideas from the work are also part of this thesis.
