#  Network Traffic Transformer (NTT)

This work was undertaken as part of my master thesis at ETH Zurich, from Feb 2022 to Aug 2022, titled `Advancing packet-level traffic predictions with Transformers`. We present a new transformer-based architecture, to learn network dynamics from packet traces.

We design a `pre-training` phase, where we learn fundamental network dynamics. Following this, we have a `fine-tuning phase`, on different network tasks, and demonstrate that pre-training well leads to generalization to multiple fine-tuning tasks.
